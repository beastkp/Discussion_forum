## DESCRIPTION:
This is a demo of a Discussion Forum which works similar to many applications which are avaliable on the browser that reply to queries

## CONTENT
This is created using React and using basic hooks like useState and useEffect apart from that the questions added in the Ask Question section upon submission immediately reflect in the trending question section.
**The user also has the choice for answering those questions if he knows the answer to some in the Trending Question's list**
### It is not so fancy looking but works!!!

## Bonus
The name is already set to default as Anonymous, but if you want you can change that to your real name or same cool gamer name!!!!
